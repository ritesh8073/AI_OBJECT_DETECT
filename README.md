# Weather Detection - Real-Time Updates

This project provides real-time weather updates using API-based data retrieval. It allows users to check current weather conditions, forecasts, and other meteorological data in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

## Features
- Real-time weather updates
- Location-based weather detection
- Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition details
- Interactive UI with dynamic updates
- Support for multiple cities

## Technologies Used
- Android (Kotlin/Java) for mobile application
- OpenWeather API for weather data
- Firebase for user authentication and data storage
- Node.js/Express (optional backend for extended functionalities)

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Android Studio
- OpenWeather API Key
- Firebase setup (optional for authentication and storage)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ritesh8073/weather-detection-real-time-updates-.git
   cd weather-detection-real-time-updates-
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Obtain an OpenWeather API key and add it to the project.
4. Configure Firebase if using authentication and storage.
5. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.

## How It Works
1. Users enter a city name or enable location services.
2. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API.
3. Weather details are displayed dynamically with periodic updates.
4. Users can view forecasts and detailed weather parameters.

## Customization
- Modify UI components in `res/layout/`.
- Update API call logic in `MainActivity.java`.
- Enhance weather visualization with animations and graphs.

## Future Enhancements
- Hourly and weekly weather forecasts
- Dark mode support
- Push notifications for weather alerts
- Integration with IoT devices for smart weather monitoring
